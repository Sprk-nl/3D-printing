Bed level basics I've used for Klipper

- set x and y bltouch/probe offset
- Add [screws_tilt_adjust] configuration section
- BED_MESH_CLEAR
- SAVE_CONFIG
- remove all bed leveling data from the config if any
- restart klipper and verify bed leveling is gone.
- PROBE_ACCURACY test your probe
- PROBE_CALIBRATE calibrate Z offset
- SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE : level on screw positions
- BED_MESH_CALIBRATE (no profile name, just default)
- SAVE_CONFIG

To verify:
- Do a G28
- Put a foled paper of 0.2mm on the bed
- go to a probed position and enter G1 Z1
- Carefully check you can go lower to G1 Z0.2
- This should just touch the paper


If you're using the graphical  octoprint bedlevelvisualizer, be aware: 
- the graph doesn't show the whole bed, only the part you've leveled.
- Check the X and Y are not inverted
